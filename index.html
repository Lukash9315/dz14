                        React Native runs on <span class="underline-text">React</span> React, a popular open source library for building user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most
                        of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get you started or can serve as a refresher
                        course.

                    <p>
                        We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>+ components</b>. The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures that
                        need names and a cafe to work in.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>+ JSX</b>. React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript like so: <span class="bg">&ltText&gtHello, I
                        am your cat! &lt/Text&gt</span>. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The React docs have <span class="underline-text">a comprehensive guide to JSX</span> you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can
                        use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <span class="bg">name</span>  for the cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces inside
                        <span class="bg">&ltText&gt</span> 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>+ props</b>. Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>+ state</b>. While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components render, state is like a
                    component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time or that comes from user
                    interaction. State gives your components memory!

                        <p class="chapter">Chapter 4</p>
                    </div>
                    <p class="handling-text">
                        TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an <span>onChangeText</span> prop that takes a function to
                        be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called when the text is
                        submitted.
                    </p>
                    <p class="handling-text">
                        For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different language. In this new
                        language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçï
                        üçï".
